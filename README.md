# 2025-optimization-course
Repository on semidefinite programming in quantum information for the course "Optimization methods for quantum information" (year 2025) held at the University of Naples Federico II.

This is a work in progress.

The codes are implemented in Python 3 using libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, cvxpy (mosek solver), scipy, time, IPython.

SUMMARY ON THE TUTORIALS

1. First encounter with SDPs: ground state energy calculation as an SDP (non-
scalable)

2. Ubiquitous SDPs: energy gap as an SDP; Helstrom bound as an SDP.

3. Certification of quantum properties under partial information. SDP for lower
bound on the fidelity of state preparation; Lower bound for purity (Schur com-
plement to obtain an SDP representation).

4. SDP relaxations via moment matrix: scalable methods for many-body systems.
Lower bound for ground state energy of the transverse field Ising model as an
illustrative example.
